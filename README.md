This is the code repository for [Early Access](https://www.packtpub.com/iot-hardware/hands-on-azure-digital-twins?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801071383), published by Packt.

**A practical guide to building distributed IoT solutions**

## What is this book about?
In todayâ€™s world, clients are using more and more IoT sensors to monitor their business processes and assets. Think about collecting information like pressure from an engine to the temperature and light switch being turned on or off in a room. The data collected can be used to create smart solutions for predicting future trends, creating simulations, and drawing insights using visualization. This makes it beneficial for organizations to make digital twins, which are digital replicas of the real environment, to support these smart solutions. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the concept and architecture of Azure Digital Twins
* Get to grips with installing and configuring the service and required tools
* Understand the Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL) and digital twin models
* Explore the APIs and SDKs available to access the Azure Digital Twins services
* Monitor, troubleshoot, and secure digital twins
Discover how to build, design, and integrate applications with various Azure services
Explore real-life scenarios with Azure Digital Twins

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
public string RelationshipId(string twinSourceId, string
twinDestinationId)
{
return string.Format("{0}-{1}", twinSourceId,
twinDestinationId);
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Azure developers, Azure architects, and anyone who wants to learn more about how to implement IoT solutions using Azure Digital Twins and additional Azure services. Prior experience using the Azure Portal and a clear understanding of building applications using .NET will be helpful.
